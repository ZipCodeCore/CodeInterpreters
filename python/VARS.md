# Python Variables Guide: A Beginner's Tutorial

This guide will help you understand different variable types in
Python using the Python interpreter environment.
We'll explore int, bool, float, and str variables
with practical examples.

## Getting Started with the Python interpreter
To begin:
1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Type `python3` (or `python`) and press Enter
3. You should see the Python prompt: `>>>`

## Integer (int) Variables
**Definition:** An integer variable stores whole numbers without decimal points.

**How to declare:**
```python
variable_name = value
```

**TYPE into Python interpreter:**
```python
>>> age = 25
>>> age
25

>>> score = 100
>>> score
100

>>> negative = -10
>>> negative
-10

>>> sum_total = age + score
>>> sum_total
125
```

Type `dir()` to see all variables in your current namespace, or use `globals()` to see global variables.

### Save your work

Save the work in a file called `vars.py`.

```python
# Exit Python interpreter with exit() or Ctrl-D
# Create a file vars.py with your variable examples

age = 25
score = 100
negative = -10
sum_total = age + score

print(f"Age: {age}")
print(f"Score: {score}")
print(f"Sum: {sum_total}")
```

Now, save the repo to your GitHub account.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Python Variables Guide"
git push
```

Go to a browser and navigate to your GitHub account to see the changes in this repository.

Okay go back to the terminal and let's continue.

## Boolean Variables
**Definition:** A boolean variable stores True/False values.

**How to declare:**
```python
variable_name = True/False
```

**TYPE into Python interpreter:**
```python
>>> is_student = True
>>> is_student
True

>>> has_passed_exam = False
>>> has_passed_exam
False

>>> result = 10 > 5
>>> result
True

>>> is_equal = (15 == 15)
>>> is_equal
True
```

## Float Variables
**Definition:** A float variable stores decimal numbers with precision.

**How to declare:**
```python
variable_name = value
```

**TYPE into Python interpreter:**
```python
>>> price = 19.99
>>> price
19.99

>>> temperature = -2.5
>>> temperature
-2.5

>>> result = 10.5 + 3.7
>>> result
14.2

>>> division = 10.0 / 3.0
>>> division
3.3333333333333335
```

## String Variables
**Definition:** A string variable stores text (sequence of characters).

**How to declare:**
```python
variable_name = "text"
variable_name = 'text'
```

Hey, here, replace "John" with your name.

**TYPE into Python interpreter:**
```python
>>> name = "John"
>>> name
'John'

>>> greeting = "Hello, World!"
>>> greeting
'Hello, World!'

>>> combined = name + " says " + greeting
>>> combined
'John says Hello, World!'

>>> empty = ""
>>> empty
''

>>> formatted = f"{name} says {greeting}"
>>> formatted
'John says Hello, World!'
```

## Python Dynamic Typing
Unlike Java, Python variables don't need type declarations. Python figures out the type automatically:

```python
>>> x = 5          # x is an int
>>> type(x)
<class 'int'>

>>> x = "hello"    # now x is a string
>>> type(x)
<class 'str'>

>>> x = 3.14       # now x is a float
>>> type(x)
<class 'float'>
```

## Practice Tips
1. Try typing these examples in the Python interpreter
2. Experiment with different values
3. Try combining variables in operations
4. Use `type(variable)` to check the type of any variable
5. Use `dir()` or `globals()` to see all variables
6. Save your work in Python files (.py extension)
7. Use `exit()` to leave the Python interpreter

Be sure to do commit of all this work to your GitHub repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Python Variables Guide"
git push
```

## Common Python Features
- **Dynamic typing**: No need to declare variable types
- **Snake_case**: Python uses snake_case for variable names (not camelCase)
- **f-strings**: Use f"text {variable}" for string formatting
- **Multiple assignment**: `x, y = 1, 2`
- **Type checking**: Use `type(variable)` to check types

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't forget that Python is case-sensitive
- Remember that strings can use single or double quotes
- Python uses `True`/`False` (capitalized) not `true`/`false`
- Use snake_case for variable names in Python
- Remember that variables are dynamically typed

This guide should give you a solid foundation for understanding and working with basic Python variables in the interpreter. Practice with these examples and try creating your own variables to become more comfortable with these concepts.
