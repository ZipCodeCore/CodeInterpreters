# Java Small

`fork` this repository and `clone` it to your local machine.

This repository contains small Java projects and guides for beginners.

There are three markdown files that will lead you thru a series of
steps to learn some beginner Java programming.

You will use `jshell` to learn about variables, methods, and classes.
**Make sure you TYPE the snippets from the markdown files into `jshell`**.
Not typing, doing copy/paste, will not help you learn (and is cheating at this point of the course)

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
cd ~/Projects
git clone https://github.com/ZipCodeCore/JavaSmall
```

Then, navigate to the repository:

```bash

Use a browser to be able to see the markdown files.
Start with `JavaSmall.md` and follow the links to the other guides.
